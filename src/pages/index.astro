        <h1>I’m HiEN</h1>
        <p class="prose">
          I’m an independent engineer and data scientist who likes building
          practical, open-source tools. My work moves between software
          engineering, analytics, and geospatial science, usually in service of
          climate analytics, automation, or resilient product design.
        </p>
        <p class="prose">
          I prototype quickly in Python, run workloads on Azure, and wire up API
          frameworks like STAC and FastAPI to connect data with decisions. The
          goal is always the same: useful software for environmental insight,
          whether that’s biodiversity monitoring, urban analytics, or improving
          data infrastructure and system reliability.
        </p>
