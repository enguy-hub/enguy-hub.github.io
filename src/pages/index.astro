        <h1>I’m HiEN</h1>
        <p class="prose">
          An independent software engineer and data scientist passionate about
          open-source solutions and impactful technology. My background spans
          software engineering, and data analytics, with strong roots in
          geospatial science, allowing me to work seamlessly across climate
          analytics, automation, and resilient product design.
        </p>
        <p class="prose">
          I prototype with Python and orchestrate cloud workloads in cloud
          platforms like Azure. My experience spans building and integrating API
          frameworks such as STAC and FastAPI, developing tools that bridge
          data, automation, and insight. I’m passionate about using technology
          for social and environmental impact, from biodiversity monitoring and
          urban analytics to mobility, energy, and forest degradation. Beyond
          geospatial domains, I enjoy tackling challenges in data
          infrastructure, environmental intelligence, and system reliability,
          always focused on creating meaningful, scalable solutions at the
          intersection of science and software.
