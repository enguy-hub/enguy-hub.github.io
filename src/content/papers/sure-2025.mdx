Centered on the land-use legend from theVietnamese Department of Natural Resourcesand Environment (DONRE), 
a thematic legendharmonization was formulated for the centralVietnamese province of Thừa Thiên Huế (TTH).
This harmonized legend facilitates interoperabilitybetween distinct land use and land covercategories, 
serving as a relevant tool for floodmanagement. It is also conducive to activitiesfocused on the integration 
of ecosystem-basedapproaches into flood risk management, therebypromoting adaptive and sustainable urbandevelopment 
in central Vietnam. Theharmonization process was executed inthree sequential phases. Initially, pertinent 
landuse and land cover products, as well as projectperspectives, were identified, and their respectivethematic 
legends were compiled. Subsequently,a land cover classification system was employedto disaggregate the legend classes 
into discretebuilding blocks, termed classifiers. Ultimately,common thematic elements were discerned,a conversion 
table was constructed to alignthe disparate legends, and a newly harmonizedlegend was generated.
