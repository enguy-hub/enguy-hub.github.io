This paper details an experiment that joined opportunistic STAC archives with low-cost microclimate
sensors. The workflow fused high-resolution thermal imagery, crowd-sourced humidity data, and
Sentinel-2 vegetation indices to infer how heat islands spike and diffuse throughout the day.

Key contributions:

1. A reproducible ingestion pipeline leveraging asynchronous FastAPI services and STAC API search.
2. Signal-processing routines that reconcile temporal gaps between orbital and in-situ observations.
3. A resilience index that flags neighborhoods where infrastructure upgrades yield the largest heat
   stress reduction.
