Astro makes it trivial to ship static HTML first, then sprinkle React where it makes sense. That hybrid rendering model fits the way I ship side projects:

1. Start fast with content collections and Markdown/MDX files.
2. Graduate to React islands whenever interactivity matters.
3. Call into FastAPI backends via a public `config.json` that maps project keys to base URLs.

I'll keep sharing architectural deep-dives and post-mortems as the projects evolve.
